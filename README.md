# Tiny Wins — Home

**Tiny tools for real progress.**

This repository powers the homepage for **tinywins.space**, the hub for the *Tiny* ecosystem.

The goal of Tiny Wins is simple:  
to help people improve a little every day — through small, focused tools that are easy to start and easy to keep using.

## 🌱 What lives here

This repo contains:
- The **homepage** for `tinywins.space`
- A simple hub that links to individual Tiny apps

The homepage is intentionally minimal and stable.  
Each product lives in its own repository and subdomain.

## 🧩 The Tiny ecosystem

- **Tiny Wins** → Habits & daily wins  
  https://wins.tinywins.space

- **Tiny Body** → Eating, calories, movement *(coming soon)*

- **Tiny Learn** → Reading lists, watch lists, learning logs *(coming soon)*

- **Tiny Money** → Monthly cost tracking & planning *(coming soon)*

Each app is designed to work independently while sharing the same philosophy and visual language.

## 🛠 Tech

- Static site
- GitHub Pages
- Custom domain via Namecheap
- No framework, no build step (by design)

This keeps the homepage fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.

## ✨ Philosophy

Progress doesn’t need to be loud.  
It just needs to be consistent.

Tiny Wins is about:
- Reducing friction
- Focusing on what matters
- Building momentum through small actions
